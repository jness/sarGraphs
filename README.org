* Requirements:
  - sysstat
  - bc
  - php > 4.x 
  - php GD support with Freetype enabled

* Installation:

  - Be sure you have sysstat installed and running. 
  
  - Clone or extract the sarGraphs source to a Web readable location,
    or a install directory of your choice.

  - Below is an example Apache configuration:
  
:   Alias /sarGraphs /usr/share/sarGraphs/htdocs
:   <Directory "/usr/share/sarGraphs/htdocs">	
:      php_flag allow_call_time_pass_reference 1
:   </Directory>


  - Test the application is working properly by running ./cron.sh as
    root. If working, you will notice in the graphs/ & raw/
    directories are populated with data:

  - Verify the data is available via the web, password can be found
    (and changed) in sarGraphs_1.1.0/password_file.php:

: http://127.0.0.1/sarGraphs

  - Create a new crontab for root similar to below (be sure to add correct paths):

: 10 * * * * /usr/share/sarGraphs/scripts/cron.sh
